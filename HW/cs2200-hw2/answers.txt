Question 1
----------

/* Fix me */
The sequence of instructions would first include performing LEA RA, 0. 
This performs the first part of JALR by storing the incremented PC into RA.

Second, because we have teh assumption, we can perform beq $zero, zero target which will
unconditionally branch us to the value of target, thereby indirectly performing the JALR
instructions.
